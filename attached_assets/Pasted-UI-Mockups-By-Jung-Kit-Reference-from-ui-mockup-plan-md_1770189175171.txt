UI Mockup Plan — SmartLocate SG (Web App)
Purpose: Provide a detailed, use-case-driven UI mockup plan for teammates to create a coherent web UI prototype.
 
1. Prototype Goals (What the UI mockups should prove)
Users can create/select a Business Profile and understand how it affects scoring.
Users can explore the map, switch overlays/layers, and score a POI quickly.
Users can save candidate sites, add notes, and compare up to 3 sites.
Users can apply scenario presets / custom weights and see scores update.
Users can see explanations that justify the score in plain language.
 
2. Primary Navigation (Proposed IA)
Global Layout
Top App Bar: App name, profile selector, scenario selector, user menu.
Left Navigation (optional): Dashboard, Map, Portfolio, Compare, Admin (if admin).
Main Content Area: Screen-specific content.
Primary Routes
/login (UC-03)
/register (UC-01/02)
/dashboard (overview + quick actions)
/profiles (UC-07)
/map (UC-10/11/12/13/14/15/22/23)
/portfolio (UC-17/18/19)
/compare (UC-20/21)
/admin (UC-25..UC-30) (optional for prototype)

5. HCI / UX Notes (What to emphasize in mockups)
Use progressive disclosure: don’t show weight sliders until the user requests.
Provide strong empty states: “Create your first business profile” with CTA.
Reduce cognitive load: default scenario + overlay; clear legends with all four dimensions.
Ensure feedback loops: loading skeletons, toasts, and visible "active profile/scenario".
Keep map controls grouped and consistent (layer toggles together).
AI Explanations: Make score explanations easily accessible and understandable without technical jargon.
User Feedback: Allow users to provide feedback on each explanation/insight to improve clarity.
